# Ice Breaker

The **Ice Breaker** project showcases my skills in Python, LangChain, and AI agents to create personalised and engaging ice-breakers for conversations. The project focuses on extracting and summarising publicly available information from social media handles to generate short, tailored introductions for individuals.

## Features
- **Social Media Integration:** Uses LangChain agents to gather relevant information from public social media handles.
- **AI-Powered Summarisation:** Processes and summarises extracted information into a concise and conversational format.
- **Python Expertise:** Demonstrates advanced programming techniques and libraries for seamless integration and automation.

## Technology Stack
- **Python:** Core programming language for building and managing the project.
- **LangChain:** Framework for constructing advanced AI workflows and agents.
- **APIs and Web Scraping:** For retrieving publicly available social media data (ensuring ethical and legal compliance).

## Use Cases
- Networking events
- Business meetings
- Personal introductions

## How It Works
1. **Input:** Provide the social media handle or profile link of the person.
2. **Processing:** The system fetches publicly available information and processes it using LangChain agents.
3. **Output:** Generates a short, personalised ice-breaker tailored to the individual.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ice_breaker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ice_breaker
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to provide the social media handle or profile link.
3. View the generated ice-breaker output.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Support for additional social media platforms
- [ ] Improved AI summarisation capabilities
- [ ] Integration with messaging platforms for direct usage
